        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is centered around several key concepts that help structure code in a more modular and reusable way. Here are the five main concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation**: This principle involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data and promotes data hiding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction**: Abstraction focuses on simplifying complex systems by exposing only the necessary parts while hiding the underlying implementation details. This allows programmers to work with high-level concepts without needing to understand all the complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance**: Inheritance enables a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, allowing for shared functionality and attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be defined in different ways for different classes, allowing for dynamic method resolution at runtime and facilitating code flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Composition**: Composition involves constructing complex objects by combining simpler objects or classes. It promotes a \"has-a\" relationship, allowing for more flexible designs and the ability to create complex types by assembling simpler, reusable components.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to make OOP a powerful paradigm for designing and managing software systems.\n"
